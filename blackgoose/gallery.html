<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/bread.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/burgers.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="juicy burgers on a cutting board" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/fish.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="baked fish with potatoes and cherry tomatoes" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Poultry</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/chicken.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="close-up of chicken wings" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>Come and enjoy our famous chicken wings, soursed locally from farmers to support our community. There's more than enough to go around!</p>

<h2>Fries for Everyone</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/fries.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="crispy fries with ketchup on a plate" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>Our fries are fried to perfection, from homegrown potatos from hard woirking farmers. With a secret recipe that hasn't changed in a decade, you will be certain that it will be good.</p>

<h2>Our Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="gallery/tabouleh.html"><img src="gallery/thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="a round serving of tabouleh on a plate" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>If you haven't tried tabouleh, now's your chance! Lettce, onion, tomato, parsley, and olive oil combine to create a beautiful Levantine salad, originating from Arab countries.</p>
